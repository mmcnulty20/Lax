### Search channels by name, with indication of channels you haven't joined<br>
* You won't be able to chat in a channel until you join, so join the channel and get relaxing<br>
* Private channels won't show up in the search bar unless you've already joined them.
<br><br><br><br><br>

### Create new channels for new groups or topics <br><br>
They'll be public by default, but you can make them private and not viewable in search<br><br>

<br><br><br>


* After making a channel, you can add all the users as members, skip adding people completely, or search for users you want to add by name (usually full name) or email<br><br>

    * Delete channels - You can delete channels you've made, removing all messages forever.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
