Found errors:
    login: ["Sorry, you entered an incorrect email address or password."],

    general: ["Something went wrong."],
    teamDetailsSetup: ["This URL is not available. Sorry!"],
    channelForm: ["That name is already taken by a channel, username, or user group."]


Weirdness with login: Multiple ways to log in:
    If you know the workspace url, search that then enter username and password
    If you don't, submit only your email and it'll send you an email to click (doesn't seem to require password)
    
    How do you do the thing with the weak/strong password?


Default text: 
    name@work-email.com
    Full Name
    Password

    display name possibility on edit, will deal with later

- [x] Add homepage image? 
- [x] Add space between `contact me` and your links - about 1 more centimeter 
- [~] get rid of the "footer +" with all the links we will not user like `for developers`, etc. 
- [~] Get rid of options on very bottom footer - have the social media links in the far right go to your social media (linked in, github, angellist, etc.) 
- [~] Sign in should turn blue and be underlined on hover 
- [ ] Lax should redirect you to the channel skeleton, so that you can use the account drop down to "sign out of workspace" (i.e. logout) 
- [ ] The signup page is all one color on slach - and does not have a header or footer 
- [ ] Have the errors on the signup page match slack 

- [~] Excellent job so far!! :) I love the beach theme
