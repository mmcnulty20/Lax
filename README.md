* Channels and Chat:
    * View channels you've joined and communicate with other people - live! No need to refresh the page.
       * You can edit and delete your messages, and changes will show up live for other users as well!
       * [ chat gif]
    * Search channels by name, with indication of channels you haven't joined
        * You won't be able to chat in a channel until you join, so join the channel and get relaxing
        * Private channels won't show up in the search bar unless you've already joined them.
        * [search gif] 
    * Create new channels for new groups or topics
        * They'll be public by default, but you can make them private and not viewable in search
            * [ toggle private gif ]
        * After making a channel, you can add all the users as members, skip adding people completely, or search for users you want to add by name (usually full name) or email
            * [ user search gif ]
    * Delete channels - You can delete channels you've made, removing all messages forever.
