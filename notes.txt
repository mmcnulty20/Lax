Found errors:
    login: ["Sorry, you entered an incorrect email address or password."],
    invite: ["Sorry, but that email is invalid."],
    general: ["Something went wrong."],
    teamDetailsSetup: ["This URL is not available. Sorry!"],
    channelForm: ["That name is already taken by a channel, username, or user group."]


Weirdness with login: Multiple ways to log in:
    If you know the workspace url, search that then enter username and password
    If you don't, submit only your email and it'll send you an email to click (doesn't seem to require password)
